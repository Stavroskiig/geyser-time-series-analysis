# Time Series Analysis - Old Faithful Geyser

This repository contains the analysis of time series data related to the eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser. The analysis was conducted as part of the "Time Series" course assignment for the academic year 2022/23 at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

## Overview

The project involves the examination of historical data, specifically the time intervals between successive eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser, with the aim of exploring potential patterns and structures in waiting times. The analysis is performed for the years 1989, 2000, 2011, and a randomly selected year between 2001 and 2010.

## Contents

- `code/`: Contains the MATLAB and Python scripts used for data analysis.
- `EruptionData/`: Includes the datasets for the respective years.
- `lab/`: Contains scripts used for data analysis.
- `labnonlinear/`: Contains scripts used for data analysis.
- `TISEAN_3.0.0-windows`: Contains TISEAN, a software project for the analysis of time series with methods based on the theory of nonlinear deterministic dynamical systems, or chaos theory.

## Project Structure

- **Linear Analysis (1989, 2000, 2011):** Linear time series analysis and prediction for the specified years.
- **Linear and Nonlinear Analysis (Chosen Year 2001-2010):** In-depth analysis, including statistical tests, dimension estimation, and predictions.
